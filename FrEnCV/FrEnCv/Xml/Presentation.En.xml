	"\nDear Sir, Madam,\n"
	
	"I am currently a 2nd year student at the school,"
	" 42, and I am looking for an internship in"
	" C#.Net, which I could begin immediately for a"
	" period of 4 to 6 months, full-time.\n"
	
	"42 is a school which obliges its students to find solutions"
	" to varied problems.\n"
	
	"To succeed you need:\n"
	
	">> [A faultless rigour]\n"
	">> [Orginisation]\n"
	">> [Good communication with one's peers]\n"
	">> [An analytical spirit]"
	"(code which conforms to the norm, and which is tested)\n"
		 
	"The school works to train developpers who are autonomous"
	" and who wish to always advance their skills, using"
	" various programming languages.\n"
	
	"Among other projects, I have had the opportunity to"
	" script in ruby, create applications that communicate"
	" with X-server in OSX and Linux, in C, to produce"
	" graphic interfaces, and to create web-sites in PHP"
	" Java, C#, Javascript, Html and Css.\n"
